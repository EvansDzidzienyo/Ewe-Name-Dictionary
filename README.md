# Ewe Name Dictionary üåç

Welcome to the **Ewe Name Dictionary**, a mini project showcasing the names from the Ewe tribe of Ghana. This project uses PHP to allow users to search for the meanings of some names in the Ewe language. The current implementation uses a `switch` function to handle the lookup process but is designed with scalability in mind, allowing future integration with a database for an enriched experience.
